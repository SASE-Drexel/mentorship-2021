about: Even though I'm basically 21 years old, I still act like a kid most of the time. I love meeting new people and can pretty chill. I do like to stay in and just watch anime for a couple of hours with a box of frosted flakes too. I love to learn, whether it's a game or how to tie a shoe, I'll definitely be interested. Also I like food, but then I can get serious food comas.

### About

Even though I'm basically 21 years old, I still act like a kid most of the time. I love meeting new people and can pretty chill. I do like to stay in and just watch anime for a couple of hours with a box of frosted flakes too. I love to learn, whether it's a game or how to tie a shoe, I'll definitely be interested. Also I like food, but then I can get serious food comas.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE Mentor, because after experiencing half of a freshman year in person and online, there were a list of things that I regret doing, but at the same time a number of things that I'm happy that I did do and I don't want anyone to make any of the same mistakes. I also want to be a SASE Mentor because it's almost second nature to me to want to help people in any way that I possibly can.

### Career Goals

Still in the air with a couple of things, but I do want to work for a bigger known corporation, maybe in medical devices. I can't say that I have a specific career goal in mind, but I hope to be able to work as hard as possible to be in a place and be proud of how far I've come.

### Co-ops

Terumo Medical Corporation, Johnson & Johnson

### Interests

I love to bullet journal and play tetris. I'm also interested in anime and drawing. I'm interested in making memories with my friends and exploring new places, whether it's a new or old location. Boba is definitely a favorite, even though my favorite flavor is milk tea. I like j-pop and k-pop, specifically DAY6. I want to get into games more, I'm not too sure which though (I do like watching people play).

### What to Expect From Me

I would try keeping in contact with them as much as possible, and if they play any games, maybe have them take the place of a mentor and let them teach me the ropes of a game. Maybe have some virtual "datesâ€ with them until we can actually meet up for a real one :)). I also plan on mentoring them not only through SASE, but also through any trouble that they might find themselves in. I do have a sweet tooth so maybe some cooking and baking nights are to be expected, as well as ðŸŽ‰introduce them to our current little familyðŸŽ‰

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to have a relationship where we can bug each other at who knows what time of day and talk about the most random things. I don't want to be a mentor, but also someone that my mentee can trust and feel comfortable about the current situation and transitioning into Drexel.
