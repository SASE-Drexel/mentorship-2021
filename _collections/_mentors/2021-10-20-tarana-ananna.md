### About

Hi, my name is Tarana and I'm a second year studying Management Information Systems. I was born in Bangladesh and I live right outside of Philly! I'm a bit shy, quiet, and introverted, but I can talk nonstop about some topics. I'm also obsessed with cats.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was a mentee last year and had an amazing mentor who I learned a lot from. I look forward to finding someone who I can genuinely help and connect with.

### Career Goals

I'm unsure about which job position I want to aim for. In the meantime, I'll be continuing my research and interning for different companies during my time at Drexel. After graduation, I want to pursue my own projects alongside having a full-time job.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I enjoy playing tennis, going on hikes, and watching anime. Some of my favorite animes are One Piece, Attack on Titan, and Demon Slayer. You can find me binge watching K-dramas at midnight often. I also love going out to eat and shopping.

### What to Expect From Me

I'll be there to answer all my mentee's burning questions and help them get acclimated to Drexel as an underclassmen. I'd also be down for casual hangouts and mental/emotional support.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want my mentee and I to become great buddies. I'll not only be there for professional, academic, general advice, but I'll also be there for their growth, comfort, and encouragement.
