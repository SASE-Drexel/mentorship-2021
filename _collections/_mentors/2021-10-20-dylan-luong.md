### About

I am someone who continuously looks for new avenues towards self-improvement. I feel like I am naturally more reserved, but once you get to know me, I start to show my more fun, carefree side. I am ambitious, reliable, and a little silly here and there.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to give back to the SASE community. I was a mentee my freshman year and a mentor my sophomore year, so I've been able to experience both sides of it. I believe that my unique experiences being on co-op, e-boards, and other projects can potentially help someone navigate through college and I will be fully committed to my mentee(s).

### Career Goals

I want to be passionate and proud of the work that I am do. My first co-op was with KKR, which is an investment firm based in NYC. The goal for my second co-op is to land a marketing role with a big company so *fingers crossed* hehe.

### Co-ops

KKR - Finance Co-op

### Interests

Basketball, squash, ping pong, boosted boarding, photography, videography, working out, marvel... mmm honestly I'm down for just about anything lol I wanna experience new things!

### What to Expect From Me

I would hope to do regular check-ins with my mentee, whether it be via text or in-person meet ups. I wanna know how they're doing and figure out where I can best help them along their college paths. Ultimately, it's up to my mentee to decide how much they want from me and it's my responsibility to make sure that I'm always there for them.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I see it as being kinda spontaneous, but like in the best way possible haha! I don't want our relationship to feel forced upon, but of course I will ALWAYS be there for my mentee! I'm super supportive and down to meet up how ever often my mentee wants to whether it be to ask questions or to just hangout.
