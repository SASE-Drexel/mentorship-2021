### About

I'm a pretty chill person and spend most of my free time doing hobbies. I'm a pretty social person and love to go out, but also need some time to stay indoors to relax. I'm also always down to try new stuff (besides vegetables).

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I hope to help my mentee get through their year at Drexel if that means through school work, answering resume/co-op questions, or just wanting to have someone to hang/go out with. I had a great mentor my freshmen year, so ever since my sophomore year, I been a mentor so I could offer the same experience.

### Career Goals

I don't have a specific specific concentration, but I know I want to work in the tech industry. My major is sort of a jack of all trades, so some of the interests I have are in coding, IT infrastructure, database, networking, security, automation, and financial technology.

### Co-ops

Philadelphia Streets Department, Lockheed Martin, JP Morgan

### Interests

I like to play basketball, watch anime, play video games (Valorant, League of Legends, Osu), yoyo (not the Chinese one), listen to a lot of edm, and go to a lot of raves! I also love chicken and especially Korean fried chicken (hmu for your Bonchon/Bbq/Soho needs).

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to be a mentor by being there for my mentee through academic and personal needs. I'll be available to talk to my mentee in person, through text, etc.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be more of a friendship where we can talk about everyday things. I hope to still act a mentor to give advice or help when needed.
