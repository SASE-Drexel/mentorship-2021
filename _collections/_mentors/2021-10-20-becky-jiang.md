### About

I live by the motto "Work hard, play hard" and try to make the most of both my professional and personal experiences. As an ENTJ, I enjoy getting to know people and their stories, maintain a balance between school, work and social life, and am passionate about continuous learning and improvement.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

As a college senior with experiences in not only going through the co-op process, but also independent search and full time recruiting, I believe I have a lot of professional career prep to offer mentees. I had a great time with my mentor when I first joined SASE, and would like to make someone else's experience better.   

### Career Goals

I love MIS + BA because it is at the intersection of business and technology, which are both my passions. I aspire to work with data, and collaborate in teams to solve problems, and I think consulting is a great middle ground for that.

### Co-ops

APO Technologies (engineering startup- Engineering Co-op), Uncommon Goods (external internship- Operations Intern), Customized Energy Solutions (Operations Analyst)

### Interests

Art galleries and museums, traveling, casual hiking, reading and trip planning

### What to Expect From Me

The relationship I would like to have with my SASE mentee would be dependent on what they'd like to get out of it. I am flexible and versatile and can offer academic, professional or even personal life advice to help a younger student navigate through their college career.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision it to be supportive, and as casual or professional as my mentee would like it to be. Ultimately this is aimed to help them grow and improve.
