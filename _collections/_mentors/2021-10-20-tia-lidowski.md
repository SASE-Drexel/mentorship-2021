### About

Hiii! My name is Tia and I'm a third-year software engineering major. I would consider myself an ambivert, but definitely more extroverted recently after being stuck at home for so long T_T. I love going out to explore the city, food spots, or other new places! I also generally like to keep myself busy with classes/work, clubs, or other random hobbies, and I'm always open to trying new things.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor because I had a valuable experience freshman year as a mentee. Being a part of the program helped me to meet and get to know more people while also gaining a good connection with an upperclassmen who was able to give me academic and career advice. Because I had such a positive experience in the mentorship program, I also want to become a mentor and help support and guide underclassmen as well.

### Career Goals

My long term career goals include being at a company where I enjoy the work and environment while also being able to make a contribution to society. My short term goals include continuing to do well at my current co-op until graduation, and securing a full time job at the same company.

### Co-ops

SAP STAR

### Interests

Some of my interests and hobbies include walking around new places, trying new foods, watching anime and Asian dramas, playing games with friends, cooking/baking, drawing and calligraphy, and listening to music (especially Jeremy Zucker, Keshi, Illenium, Porter Robinson, etc).

### What to Expect From Me

I think that both my academic and career experience will help me to provide good advice and assistance to my mentee. After already completing one co-op as well as working through the struggles of course planning, I would be able to provide support, advice, or resources, or also just being a listening ear for my mentee if they are struggling with their own academic and career decisions. Regarding the more social aspect of the mentorship program, I also want to help my mentee be/stay involved in SASE and other organizations (if they are interested in them also) while also just being a friend that they can rely on for any other kind of support.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I would hope to be both a friend and a mentor to my mentee -- I want to be able to help them with their academic and career goals and provide advice and support when they need, but be able to develop a friendship also!
