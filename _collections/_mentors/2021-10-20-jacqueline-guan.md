### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Why not? I met my true love freshmen year in a girl named Kathy Chung... ever since then I've been hooked! JK JK, but not really... SASE Mentorship is just another amazing way to give back to the community. I want to love my menteeee

### Career Goals

Ya know... that's still something that I'm trying to figure out. As long as I end up being able to pay off my bills, that's all I really want. I have a lot of interests and I love learning new things, so we shall see where life takes me!

### Interests

I like to do art like calligraphy or bullet journaling or graphic design! I love sports like tennis or swimming, or doing anything outdoorsy like hiking. In my free time, you can also catch me playing some kind of a game, whether it's Valorant or Terraforming Mars or Egyptian Rat Screw. And... I always love a good c-drama or k-drama or anime <3
