### About

Down to earth and always up to try new things. I play Valorant and League, but have a never ending list of hobbies.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

To make a friend that I can help throughout their Drexel experience while making some exciting memories. I want to share my knowledge and advise them through their experience here.

### Career Goals

I want to find a computer engineering job that will stay exciting to me and keep me engaged. If not, hopefully a business job in technology.

### Co-ops

none

### Interests

Video games(League and Valorant mostly), cardistry, keyboards, kdramas, fashion, drawing,photography, Gundam building, always trying to learn something new

### What to Expect From Me

Do my best in supporting them and helping them in their studies, but also remind them to relax every once and a while. Give some advice that will help them in the long run.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Our relationship would be a lifelong friendship where we can depend on each other and I can be someone they can go to with any problem throughout their experience, and maybe even after.
