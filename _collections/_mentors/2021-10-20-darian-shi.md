### About

I think I'm a pretty authentic and down-to-earth person, but also definitely very analytical and goal-oriented. I really like to focus on being self-actualizing and constantly improving/growing. I generally like to plan a lot, but also see the value in being spontaneous!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've been a part of SASE for all of my college career and I always come back to the mentorship program to give back to the underclassmen. I want to share my experiences and knowledge with others and help them through their own college journeys.

### Career Goals

I hope to apply my experiences in software and web development to a project or application that has a mission or purpose that I support and believe in. I also want to be able to just work in a field that I'm able ot try many new things and have flexbility in how I work, what I work on, etc.

### Co-ops

Susquehanna International Group (Network Security Co-op), Phoodie INC. (Full-stack Developer), Imalogix (Full-stack and Software Developer)

### Interests

I spend a lot of time rock climbing nowadays, but I also enjoy video games, watching shows, skating (inline, ice, and longboarding), cooking, biking, and reading. A few strange hobbies of mine include specialty coffee and building custom mechanical keyboards.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to mentor my SASE Mentee by offering them access to any resources that I have, as well as providing myself as a resource for experience, knowledge, advice, etc.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to have a relaxed and close friendship with my mentee, being able to offer them my knowledge and experience but also learn from them as well.
