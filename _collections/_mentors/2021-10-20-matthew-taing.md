### About

I'm a junior studying Computer Science, who is still pretty active on campus. I'm currently on coop, but you'll find me around at student org events and around campus. I identify as an introvert, but I'm generally straight-forward and easy to talk to.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I really enjoy getting to know the new members of SASE and helping them out if they need any advice. I'd love to make more friends and stick around as long as possible. 

### Career Goals

I hope to finish up my degree at Drexel, and then look for opportunities, preferably remote or hybrid in a big city. 

### Co-ops

Stealth Software Developer Coop - Unisys
Full-stack Developer Coop - Vanguard
Full-stack Developer Coop - Vanguard

### Interests

I like video games, board games, volleyball, basketball, anime, boba, investing, and late-night walks as well as food adventures, traveling, and road-trips.

### What to Expect From Me

Would like to have a give and take relationship where we can reach out and talk to each other or ask questions/hang out. If they need help/advice on navigating Drexel, campus life, or their career, I'm available.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

A relationship where we're both equals and can learn from each other. I hope that we can hang out, gaming, or finding new food spots.
