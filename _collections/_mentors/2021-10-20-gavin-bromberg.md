### About

I would identify, philosophically, as a utilitarian hedonistic transhumanist. I believe that life is all about maximizing happiness, and all resources in life should be in pursuit of that goal. Technology should be used to advance the human condition and stretch the notion of what it means to be so.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

One of the best ways to grow as a person is to teach others. Furthermore, teaching also cements the knowledge that one already possesses because that prior knowledge is challenged.

### Career Goals

After I graduate, I plan to job hop for roughly half a decade and then I'll start my own business.

### Co-ops

Lead Software Engineer, MacguyverTech

### Interests

Transhumanism, philosophy, chess, systems programming

### What to Expect From Me

I'm not entirely sure because the way I would mentor an individual would be entirely driven by that person's needs. However, I would put an emphasis on intellectual exploration.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Not sure. I haven't done this before, so we'll have to see. It could become quite close, or it could be strictly professional.
