### About

I'm energetic and friendly and I love getting to know people and really do like being a helping hand to others when the opportunity comes. I'm very passionate about many things, including music, cooking, talking about random interesting topics, life, and my faith. I like to keep my life organized a bit so that I know when I can take a break and relax, usually by watching a good show and eating some good food. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I personally would have loved to have a guide and mentor my freshman year to talk about college life and how to navigate all the little things that come with it. I was able to get a lot of helpful advice from a lot of older students and friends and that really helped me feel more confident in my future as a college student and to feel like I could do it. So it would be so fun if I could help out another underclassman in the same way so many helped me out my first years at Drexel! Drexel has a lot to offer but it's hard to navigate sometimes so I'd love to be that guide for someone :)

### Career Goals

I hope to become a physical therapist in the next few years (maybe in 4 years if I continue in Drexel's Accelerated Doctor of PT tract!)

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Cooking, baking, music (I play the clarinet and piano), having good conversations, exploring the city.

### What to Expect From Me

Most likely through texts and a few in person meet ups, maybe grab some food together. I'm currently in a very busy time (getting shadowing hours, CO-OP job searches, studying for MARC-ACSM College bowl, concert band, etc.) so I may not be able to make many do much in person things, so I'll probably mostly offer advice.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to be good friends and to be able to share my experiences with them and to encourage them on their college journey.
