about: I contain multitudes. I'm a huge nerd that loves manga and video games and can be really introverted and quiet at times, but I'm also a retired male gymnast that hits the gym regularly, and can be super loud and energetic when around people I'm comfortable with. I'm also *really* good at card games and can teach you a lot of them.

### About

I contain multitudes. I'm a huge nerd that loves manga and video games and can be really introverted and quiet at times, but I'm also a retired male gymnast that hits the gym regularly, and can be super loud and energetic when around people I'm comfortable with. I'm also *really* good at card games and can teach you a lot of them.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Throughout my life I've been a mentor for many people, like my younger brother and the younger kids on my gymnastics team, and I've found that I genuinely really enjoy it. Giving advice and helping people understand concepts is something that comes naturally to me at this point, and I hope I can leverage those skills to give back to the SASE community in a meaningful way.

### Career Goals

Still not 100% certain on anything (who is?), but for now I just want to make bank with some kind of Software/Data Science job, probably at a bigger company (got HUGE V-bucks at Vanguard) but open to smaller companies too. Eventually I want to move into a position where I can teach/consult for people (professorship? private tutor? coaching?) and/or make educational content (youtube? khan academy/coursera/udemy?).

### Co-ops

Vanguard - Software Developer, NewLane Finance - Data Scientist Co-op

### Interests

Card games (ERS, Poker, Hearthstone, Yugioh, MtG, Pokemon etc.), Video Games (Smash Ultimate, League, Genshin), Anime/Manga (Shonen/Seinen and Slice of Life), Gymnastics/Parkour/Calisthenics, Music (play the violin, listen to Rock, JPop, some Kpop)

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to adapt as needed to my mentees' needs, and there's a variety of things I can do for you. Whether you want help studying, picking classes, resume reviews/interview prep, someone to vent to, work out with, or even just play games together and give you anime/manga recommendations, I can do it all. I'll make sure to check-in regularly with you, but I hope you'll also be proactive about reaching out to me.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Very friendly and casual at times, like sending memes to each other or meeting up just to grab food and hang out/play games together, but also more serious at other times, like providing you emotional support and helping you develop as a person.
