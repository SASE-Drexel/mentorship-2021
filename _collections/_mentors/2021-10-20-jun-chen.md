### About

I used to be pretty introverted, but I've become an ambivert over the pandemic!
I consider myself to be pretty laid-back, but I love to cause chaotic energy everywhere I go. 

Fun Fact: I once spent 70 dollars on Wagyu just to put it on a slice of Costco pizza. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I joined SASE last year, and I missed my chance last year, so this is my only chance to be a mentor now! I already mentor a lot of my underclassmen, as well as my sister so it feels like being a mentor will come naturally to me. 

### Career Goals

I'm currently trying to get a high-paying engineering job once I graduate, work until I'm 45, retire, and then spend the rest of my life exploring the world until I meet my demise in a tropical storm at the ripe old age of 57 and get lost at sea, forever. 

### Co-ops

Estee Lauder, Xyntek

### Interests

I'm really into 3D printing and video games(catch me on Val and League!!) I love to just build random stuff using what I've learned at Drexel and my past experiences at my coops. I used to be a big anime watcher, but that stopped once I got a PS5 :-)

### What to Expect From Me

I'll be encouraging them throughout their Drexel journey and be open for any questions they will have about Drexel, CO-OP, or just life in general. I'll also try to be reliable in case they need a favor, a friend to talk to, or just someone to show them the best boba places at CT!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I will be sensei Jubby, and I will teach them everything I've learn at Drexel over the past 5 years. I also want to be a reliable mentor, and someone they can come to if they ever need a favor. Also... boba buddies?
