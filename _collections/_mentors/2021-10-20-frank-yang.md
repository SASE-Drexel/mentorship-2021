### About

I constantly make jokes that are not funny and in perpetual torment from school. I push my sleep schedule to hang out with friends for movies, video games, and talking about nonsense. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I had a lot of people help me along the way, so I wanted to give back.

### Career Goals

I hope to be able to work in aerospace and defense. I want to keep learning and get into hypersonic. The other route I is to dip into engineering wise is just to be able to design cool toys for the military.

### Co-ops

Material Sciences LLC

### Interests

Academic wise I like to to dive deeper into aerospace and keep learning. 

For a personal aspect I love martial arts, cooking food, and working out. 

Overall, I hope to keep working on things for self improvement.

### What to Expect From Me

Everybody is different so I don't have a plan! I would say I did pretty good at my STEM courses so I could potentially help with those. Otherwise, I can be another person to give you advice academically or real life. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

It can be anything from a friendship or mostly academic. No plans.
