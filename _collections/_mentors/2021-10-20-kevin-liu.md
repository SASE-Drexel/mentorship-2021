### About

Casual, relaxed person with a long to-do list. I'm more on the introverted side, but I talk a lot to people that I'm closer with. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I believe I have the experience and qualifications to mentor others. I also enjoy helping people find opportunities and be productive. I have a lot of experience with Drexel, organizations, professional experiences, and more. I want to create new connections as well.

### Career Goals

I am currently seeking to get more into the technology field (software dev, fintech, programming, etc). I am undecided between that and engineering careers due to the large variety of possibilities. I'm taking the opportunities I can to learn more.

### Co-ops

1st - Merck, Quality Assurance Associate Specialist
2nd - Radius Systems LLC, Engineering Coop

### Interests

Chess, Cooperative games (overcooked), social deduction games (secret hitler, amogus), League of Legends, simulation games (car mechanic + pc building), making stuff, programming, stonks, eating, sleeping

### What to Expect From Me

It will also depend on what they want - I have experience with the Drexel system, minors, engineering and CS courses, etc. I am also available for personal and professional development, whether that's self reflection, resume reviews, personal goals/growth, and just casual chats. I'm a pretty flexible person and I'm always willing to learn new things.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I can see a very casual relationship - they can ask me questions whenever, but our communication is not limited to just help/questions. It's really going to depend on whatever we agree with.
