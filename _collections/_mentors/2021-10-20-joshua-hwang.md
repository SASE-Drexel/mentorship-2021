### About

 Some basic information about me is that I'm from Cupertino,California and I'm a second year student in CS. My favorite places to be is in the outdoors especially in nature preserves and beaches. I would describe myself as a mellow, outgoing, social person that finds joy in making close connections with people.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor because I feel like I can give valuable insight from my personal experiences. I feel like I got a valuable experience from having a mentor this year and I want to be that same person for someone else. 

### Career Goals

Currently, I do not have a certain company I want to work for but I am focused on improving my hard skills in CS to make sure that when the time comes, the job opportunities that I want will be available to me.

### Co-ops

none

### Interests

For sports, I enjoy boxing, rock climbing, and running. I go to the DAC center to rock climb around 3-4 times a week. Some of my other hobbies are thrifting and jewelry making. I've made pendants and rings out of silver and want to try gold or platinum soon.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to mentor my SASE mentee by being someone who they can openly come to for personal and/or professional advice. I want to be a friend to them and someone they can be comfortable to be around. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision that we become and stay good friends over the years through Drexel and that I become someone that they can consistently depend on for advice or just to hang out.
