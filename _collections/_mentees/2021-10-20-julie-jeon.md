### About

Hi I'm Julie! I'm a first year majoring in Health Science and I'm from California so I have no idea where anything is. I may come off as shy but I like to think I am pretty outgoing when I become more comfortable. But I am insanely camera shy so most of the photos I have come out blurry.

### Career Goals

My career goals are most definitely to get into med school and become a physician. I haven't really decided what specialty but I am open to all fields as of now.

### Interests

Sleeping. But, probably things like cooking, going out with friends, finding good food spots, and playing any video game that my macbook(unfortunately) can handle.

### Looking For

Someone that is easy to talk to and can just make the energy fun! Also someone that has a lot of knowledge about the classes I will take, like some general guidance about college.
