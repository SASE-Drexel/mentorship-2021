### About

Overall, I would say I'm attempting to be organized and pretty social, and as a half-Asian I enjoy getting in touch with this side of identity/having an accepting community.

### Career Goals

Majoring in chemical engineering, I want to finish by doing food engineering. Flavor industry, development, and preservation of food are my main interests in the industry.

### Interests

The engineering major with only creative hobbies; cooking, art, and music take up my free time. I'm in polka band with my friends on campus on violin and play flute in the pep band. As well as this, I enjoy reading and collecting manga.

### Looking For

I'm looking for an upperclassman that is in engineering primarily since it seems to be a program with a lot of dropouts/transfers. I'm a little nervous about doing my major and would like someone that has been there and can help me academically (especially with some of the heavier math courses) and mentally.
