### About

Hi, I'm Jae. I'm pretty chill and like to do nothing. I'm a first-generation Korean, I like food, sleeping, and music. Not too sure how to describe myself, but having another friend I could talk too would be cool.

### Career Goals

I'm not sure what my end career goals are. I just want to do something involving CS.

### Interests

I CAN play video games, but I'm currently recovering from my addiction so I rarely play anymore, I like anime, doing nothing, hanging out, the usual.

### Looking For

I wanted to try this out, and I thought that joining this program couldn't hurt. Like I wrote above, I think having another friend would be really cool, and I think I could learn a lot. I'm hoping to stay ahead of everything from my mentor's advice/suggestions, and that's about it.
