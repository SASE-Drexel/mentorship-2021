### About

I'd like to think I'm pretty outgoing and I always enjoy meeting new people and making friends! I've been in Philly my whole life, but I'm still not well-versed in all the best places to visit, so I'm always down to explore the city! I also love dogs.

### Career Goals

I'm currently a Comp Sci major, but I'm still indecisive about what I want to do in the future. I definitely prefer being creative and working through a design process, and would possible like to go into game/app design.

### Interests

I generally just love going out and exploring new places and finding cool boba shops! I spend most of my free time on Netflix, and my favorite shows at the moment are Criminal Minds and Avatar (always a classic). I also listen to all types of music, so I'll always accept song/artist recommendations!

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor who I can feel comfortable talking to as both a friend and a guide, someone I can be personal with and also rely on for professional advice. I'd also prefer a mentor with some co-op experience to help me through the process.
