### About

I am a very lost college student. I am the first in my family to go to Drexel. I am a first-generation Chinese immigrant who came to Philly. I had always operated within my comfort zone, but I have started to expand that zone. Since quarantine, I am more open to trying out new things and meet new people. 

### Career Goals

I haven't look that far ahead but my current short term goal is to find the possible first steps into looking for a career outside of school. 

### Interests

I recently gotten into many hobbies during of Quarantine, but I really want to get into Cars  but I have no resources nor time to devote into getting more into it. 

### Looking For

For a mentor, I want someone who is relatable and easy to talk to for me who can guild or give me tips for going through life in college.
