### About

My name is Zhuoxi (Joyce ) and I like to draw during my free-time (basically my entire personality). I’m an introvert (ISFP) and I like the color pink :)

### Career Goals

My goal is to become a pediatrician-specifically in emergency medicine.

### Interests

I love ducks, flowers, art and I have a love-hate relationship with valorant.

### Looking For

I would love to have a mentor just so I could meet new people as well as someone who is more experienced than me so I can go to them for any questions I have.
