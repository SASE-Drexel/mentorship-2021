### About

I'm a freshman majoring in CS. I'm a bit shy and reserved when meeting new people, but I gradually become comfortable and open up. Recently, I've been into watching shows and playing games. I used to play the violin and would love to pick it up again and relearn it. I would describe myself as an ambivert because I love going out with friends. One thing I'd like to do is try all the food nearby and visit Chinatown. Academically, I strive to do well in my classes. 

### Career Goals

I am unsure, but currently, I want to work in the game development industry.

### Interests

I am interested in a lot of Asian entertainment such as anime, manga, light novels, k-pop, and dramas. Outside of that, I enjoy reading fantasy novels and watching a variety of shows. I play video games casually. I also like to bake and to cook. 

### Looking For

I am looking for a mixture of all three in my mentor- professional, academic, and personal. The first two is more so just to help me with my studies and to help me understand the co-op process. However, I am primarily looking for a personal mentor, someone who shares the same interests as I do and someone to hang out with.
