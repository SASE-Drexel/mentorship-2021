### About

I am kind and friendly, and someone that is willing to explore new interests/things even though I spend most of my time being lazy. At first I'm a little introverted but can open up to new people quickly. 

### Career Goals

Hoping to get a stable career/job in the mechanical engineering field and work with CAD designs.

### Interests

I like to play video games, the occasional reading, and chess. Also I do like memes and jokes, listening to music, and watching shows when I can.

### Looking For

Someone who can give me advice in personal/social things when I need it, as well as professionally if need be. Mostly looking for a friend type relationship and someone to talk to and have fun.
