### About

Hello! My name is Chris Wi. I am a Sophomore Electrical Engineering major currently in a co-op with NAVSEA. I am looking forward to learning so much in the next couple of months. I don't know yet what I want to focus on, so I am just trying different things out and seeing what sticks. I really like talking to people and getting to know them, but the hard part for me is introducing myself to others.

### Career Goals

My dream is to work at a company like Tesla because EVs are the future of automotive transportation. Or to snag a job at Teenage Engineering, where I could combine my love for music and technology.

### Interests

My main interests are video games, cooking, audio technology, anime, and music. I am always looking for new recipes to try. I just wish I had an unlimited budget for groceries because I want to cook everything! There is a chance that I'll know how to play your favorite song on the ukulele*. (very small chance)

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor that I can talk to about both serious things and not-so-serious things. Someone who can put up with my dumb questions because I tend to have a lot. I also want to improve my time management and networking skills. Most importantly, I want someone to get hotpot with.
