### About

If I would describe myself, I would say that I am a chill person. If i wanted to throw some adjectives out the the top of my head, I would say I am honest, determined, flexible, considerate, and optimistic. I used to be introverted , but I think I'm starting to grow out of that shell and I've been making good progress.

### Career Goals

To be completely honest, my career goals are to just be economically stable and free.

### Interests

I like anime and stuff. I play games like minecraft, genshin, overwatch, valorant, etc

### Looking For

As long as they are friendly and helpful, i'm fine with anyone. At the moment, i'm not looking for a mentor for a specific reason.
