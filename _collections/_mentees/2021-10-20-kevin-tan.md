### About

Hello, my name is Kevin, i'm a 1st year majoring in CS, and I'm from New York. I would say that I am a chill person and i like relaxing, watching shows and playing games etc. I used to be bit introverted, but I think I'm starting to grow out of that shell and I've been making good progress.

To be completely honest, my career goals are to just be economically stable and free.

### Interests

I like anime and stuff. I play games like minecraft, genshin, overwatch, valorant, etc

### Looking For

As long as they are friendly and helpful, i'm fine with anyone. At the moment, i'm not looking for a mentor for a specific reason.
