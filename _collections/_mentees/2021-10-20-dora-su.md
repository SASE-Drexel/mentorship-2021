### About

I'm from Taiwan and this is my second year in Drexel and fifth year in the US. Besides school work I'm also very interested in playing guitar! 

### Career Goals

For now my career goal is probably obtaining a CPA license after graduation! 

### Interests

I started playing guitar during quarantine and took some lessons while I was in Taiwan. I didn't bring my guitar here so I just bought one a few weeks ago and right now I just play it when we I'm stressed. 

### Looking For

Since this is my first year on campus, I'm most likely looking for a mentor who could help me familiarize with the whole face to face situations in Drexel!
