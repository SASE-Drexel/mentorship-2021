### About

I'm a bit of an introvert but once I get to know someone I can open up to them easily. I love to learn about new things and I'm very open-minded. I'm not sure what else to say about myself but I would consider myself easy to talk to and chill! 

### Career Goals

I might want to work in web development but I'm not sure. I know I wanna work somewhere cool like Google or Instagram because I know they have many different roles and I feel like I could find what works best for me.

### Interests

I love listening to music mostly rn&b and rap/pop but I'll listen to anything but country  lol. some of my favorite artists are Tyler the creator, Kendrick Lamar, solange, steve lacy and a ton more. I also like to bake from time to time, take walks, and chill with family/friends when I have free time. I also love plants and marvel 

### Looking For

I'm looking for both friendship and academic help if possible. Someone I can talk to casually but can also offer academic advice. If both together aren't possible, either a personal or Academic  mentor is fine too!
