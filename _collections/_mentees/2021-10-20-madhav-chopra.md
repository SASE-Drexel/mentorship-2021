about: I am mostly on the introvert side. it is one of the limitations of me in a certain sense because my networking is a bit affected by it. But I really like to dig deep because of it so it is a strength too. I really love to do things with passion and I cannot do those things which I'm not passionate about. I believe in living the life not just passing it. I'm a Harry Potter fan, I also love to read books specifically Shakespeare, and I also like to write about my life and some issues in general.

### About

I am mostly on the introvert side. it is one of the limitations of me in a certain sense because my networking is a bit affected by it. But I really like to dig deep because of it so it is a strength too. I really love to do things with passion and I cannot do those things which I'm not passionate about. I believe in living the life not just passing it. I'm a Harry Potter fan, I also love to read books specifically Shakespeare, and I also like to write about my life and some issues in general.

### Career Goals

I'm not fully sure what my future career looks like. But I want to do something that I can live and breathe in. I want to follow my passion. I'm still on the process to figure that out. It is one of the reasons I'm considering the change of major.
