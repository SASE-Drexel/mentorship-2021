### About

I'm pretty quiet and chill for the most part. I wanna say that I'm friendly to everyone. I'm always down to travel to new places. Being spontaneous is fine with me. And I love food :)

### Career Goals

Maybe to end up having some sort of career in the business entertainment industry. I'm not really sure. I chose to be an Accounting major mainly due to enjoying a BUS 101 class I took during high school. If it weren't for that class, I'd honestly probably be an undecided major.

### Interests

Hobbies include anything music related, finding new places to go to, watching Netflix, being in my room lol

### Looking For

Probably someone who was shaky/unsure (career-wise) going into their first year. It'd be great if they could talk about the activities on campus and how I, as a commuter, can get more involved as well. I'd say I'm fine academically though I wouldn't mind a little extra help in a class like English.
