### About

I am an international student from Karachi, Pakistan who is also first generation college student. This has been my first time coming to the USA. However, I never felt overwhelmed as I was aware of the culture of the USA.

### Career Goals

I want to work after graduation. My program is 4 years for now with one coop but I am in two minds if I should go for 5 year 3 coop program. 

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I want to seek information which type of activities can strengthen my resume. In freshman year, I have time to do so much but I don't know what to do. I am thinking to join few clubs. Also, it would be great if my mentor advises on how to get good coop and how to prepare for it from perspective of a student.
