about: Hello! My name is Yun Seo Hur but you can just call me by my English name Jacob. I am a sophomore following the pre-med track as a chemistry major in Drexel University. My goal is to become a surgeon in the future. I am the oldest of three siblings and was born in South Korea (Cool fact- my baby sister is only 4 years old). I love staying active and like to play almost all sports. I also like to listen/play music in my free time. Although I might be a little bit shy at first, I love meeting and making new friends. I enjoy hanging out with friends a lot and consider those times to be very valuable. I am looking to meet many new people from SASE and hope that I get to make a lot of friends.

### About

Hello! My name is Yun Seo Hur but you can just call me by my English name Jacob. I am a sophomore following the pre-med track as a chemistry major in Drexel University. My goal is to become a surgeon in the future. I am the oldest of three siblings and was born in South Korea(Cool fact: my baby sister is only 4 years old). I love staying active and like to play almost all sports. I also like to listen/play music in my free time. Although I might be a little bit shy at first, I love meeting and making new friends. I enjoy hanging out with friends a lot and consider those times to be very valuable. I am looking to meet many new people from SASE and hope that I get to make a lot of friends. 

### Career Goals

My goal for the future is to become a surgeon. I have always liked helping people out from when I was a kid and one of my goals in life was to save a person's life. After a long time of thinking, I thought that a surgeon would be the job fit the best for me. This is also the reason why I have picked chemistry as my major. 

### Interests

I love sports and music. I have tried all kinds of sports from joining the track team, tennis team, volleyball team, and even did Taekwondo. For instruments, I play the cello and a little bit of guitar and piano. I also love hanging out with friends. I always try to meet new people and make new friends. 

### Looking For

I am personally looking for a mentor that I could be friends with. Coming back from the pandemic, it was rather hard meeting new people because of the long isolation time everyone had to experience. I feel like this mentor/mentee program is great for getting to know new people and making new friends. I would also like it if my mentor could also help me with some of my academic classes. For example, physics. I have no idea what is going on in that class.
