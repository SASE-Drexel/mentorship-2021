### About

I'm a sophomore. I was born in India but lived in the US for the last 8ish years. I like meeting new people and discovering new things. I'm a pretty chill dude who loves to socialize.

### Career Goals

By the end of college, I would like to have worked on interesting projects and finish strong academically. In addition, I want to network and join as many organizations as I can.

### Interests

I spend most of my time listening to different types of music. I love watching movies, tv shows, and anime. I work out and try to stay active as much as I can. Working on random projects, mainly programming and business-related, is another hobby of mine. I also like to cook and explore interesting places. 

### Looking For

I wish to connect with someone who is as ambitious and fun as I am. Someone who is open and willing to communicate. Having similar interests would make communicating much easier.
