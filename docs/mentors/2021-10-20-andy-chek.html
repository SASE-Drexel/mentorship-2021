  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi everyone I‚Äôm Andy!! I‚Äôm an extroverted person trying to make the most of his time before being thrown out into the real world after graduation. I‚Äôm always down for spontaneous adventures and opportunities to explore. Big foodie? Me too! Ready to hangout and/or get boba at all times.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>During my time at Drexel, I have learned a lot since starting out as an introverted freshman. I have grown through joining clubs like SASE and ASA, and putting myself out there. As I have experienced both success and heartbreak at this university, I hope to pass that knowledge down and help my potential mentee become their best self faster and help them through the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù. I also want to help people be confident in themselves by giving them advice I have learned from my leadership experiences.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm very interested in getting into the field of Robotics. Watching Boston Dynamics videos me feel inspired to learn about applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Outside of landing a solid job, I hope to also be in the position to be able to explore interests/have fun!</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Agilence, Inc. - Data Integrations Intern/Co-Op</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Watching YouTube/Netflix, Running, Hosting ‚Äúsad boi hours‚Äù/a mini-therapy session, Networking, Participating in group activities</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I hope to keep in regular contact with my SASE Mentee. I want to be a resource for them for whenever they are experiencing hard times and are not sure about what direction to go in. I also hope to take them out to SASE events to get them to network with other people in the SASE community. Upperclassmen also might be scary to talk to so I hope to connect them to my Junior and Senior friends whenever both parties have free time. One thing I really want to do is to got out for hot pot/kbbq with my mentorship family (including Quynh and Jenny Mai).</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I hope to have a very social relationship with my mentee assuming that they also want to be in close contact with me! I would like to provide them with life advice and the tools to be able to tackle whatever comes their way. I also want to give them confidence in their abilities and to not be afraid of being themself.</p>
