  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm a quiet and adventurous introvert who likes to stay in and play games on my Switch, watch anime while eating mangoes, or decorate my planner; you might also find me on walks catching Pok√É¬©mon or grabbing boba with friends. I‚Äôm studious, passionate about learning, and an orch dork, so school-life balance is a constant work in progress. Always in some type of crisis because I‚Äôm indecisive and a ~certified overthinker~. Though I‚Äôm a bit awkward and reserved, I‚Äôm pretty chill and enjoy good memes.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve once been compared to a therapy dog in that I don‚Äôt say much, but my presence alone is comforting. While this is good, I‚Äôve always wanted to actively help someone, yet never really knew how or had the means. I‚Äôve had many rewarding experiences, including research, opportunities abroad, and scholarships/fellowships, and I feel like I have a lot to share to help someone else navigate their college career. With the pandemic, I‚Äôve also been hoping to make a new friend. I wasn‚Äôt able to get a mentee last year, so I‚Äôm hoping to try again and put myself out there.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Planning to continue my studies in Epidemiology post-undergrad, but still exploring specific roles and finding my niche. Whether working in government (FDA/CDC/NIH) or industry (pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer healthcare), my ultimate career goal is to reduce health disparities globally and help improve health outcomes of disadvantaged minority populations.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve been playing violin for 14 years (therefore√¢‚Ç¨¬¶orch dork). I listen to kpop (too much), jpop, lofi, and game/film OSTs. I like anime/kdramas and video games (e.g. Zelda, Fire Emblem, Pok√É¬©mon, Xenoblade, Cookie Run, recently Genshin). I‚Äôm a big foodie and love trying new foods and boba spots √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú milk tea or yakult are my go-tos! I also enjoy writing; I‚Äôm into stationery and mechanical keyboards and am always trying to create the perfect desk setup.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I hope to make myself available for my mentee both virtually and in-person and plan to reach out on a regular basis to start conversations about academics, professional/career goals, or life in general. I also plan to be present at as many SASE events and mentorship-specific events as I can to help them feel as connected as possible to the organization.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>A relationship that is casual, comfortable, yet fruitful. As a mentor, I‚Äôm open to sharing my college experiences and advice; however, I hope that our relationship becomes a genuine friendship where we can grab food, study to lofi music, play games, send random memes, and just chat about life together!</p>
