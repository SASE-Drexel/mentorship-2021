  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am a chill and outgoing person that wants to try new things and find new experiences in life. I typically have a good laugh about everything and not take things seriously. I also like a good meme when I see one.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>Since I am a third-year, I have had a lot of experience with classes and teachers and just how Drexel works to be able to offer help to anyone that needs it. I enjoy being able to help people be more comfortable in college and get out of their comfort zone as well.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I would like to work for a tech company in the cyber security or information technology industry. I think that these two fields are growing rapidly and would be something I want to learn more about.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Desktop Services Analyst - National Board of Medical Examiners
Website Manager - Mama May I Shop</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>My favorite hobbies are playing video games, tennis and computer building. I mostly play Valorant and Genshin Impact but I pretty much played any game you can think of. I listen to music a lot but it‚Äôs mostly K-pop. I also enjoy eating some good foods and travel wherever I can.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to mentor my SASE Mentee as someone that they can look to if they have a problem with anything they have in mind. Having a familiar face on campus would also be something I would want to be for my mentee as well.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision my relationship with my mentee as more of a friendship. Being able to be a resource to help with anything Drexel or life related as well as be a friend to my mentee.</p>
