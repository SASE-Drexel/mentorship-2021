  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Some basic information about me is that I‚Äôm from Cupertino,California and I‚Äôm a second year student in CS. My favorite places to be is in the outdoors especially in nature preserves and beaches. I would describe myself as a mellow, outgoing, social person that finds joy in making close connections with people.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a SASE mentor because I feel like I can give valuable insight from my personal experiences. I feel like I got a valuable experience from having a mentor this year and I want to be that same person for someone else.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Currently, I do not have a certain company I want to work for but I am focused on improving my hard skills in CS to make sure that when the time comes, the job opportunities that I want will be available to me.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>none</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>For sports, I enjoy boxing, rock climbing, and running. I go to the DAC center to rock climb around 3-4 times a week. Some of my other hobbies are thrifting and jewelry making. I‚Äôve made pendants and rings out of silver and want to try gold or platinum soon.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to mentor my SASE mentee by being someone who they can openly come to for personal and/or professional advice. I want to be a friend to them and someone they can be comfortable to be around.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision that we become and stay good friends over the years through Drexel and that I become someone that they can consistently depend on for advice or just to hang out.</p>
