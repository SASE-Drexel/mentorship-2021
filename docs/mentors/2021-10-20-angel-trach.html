  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Wassuppp, my name is Angel and I‚Äôm from the Bay Area in California. Though I tend to seem more introverted and shy at first, I am very warm and friendly once you get to know me. Contrary to popular belief, I am NOT SCARY AT ALL. I love to just do whatever interests me without any detailed plans and I love to explore. If you‚Äôre down to build or try something new, hit me up because I‚Äôm always down. Oh, and I‚Äôm always down for coffee or food dates :))))</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>My experience as a SASE mentee my freshman was one of the best experiences I had here at Drexel. Although I am quite introverted, this program really helped me network and make a lot of new friends. It also provided me with a community that I can always go back to during my time at Drexel. I want to be able to provide my mentee the same great experience that I had here at SASE Drexel.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My ideal would be to complete my MBA after graduating from Drexel. After that, I would like to work in the robotics or automation industry. I‚Äôve always been interested in medical robotics or any other type of robotics project. Ultimately, I just want to work on an interesting project and build something.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Public EV Charger startup in SV</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>You know how there‚Äôs always things you‚Äôre interested in but you can never find the time for it? Mine would be sleep. Contrary to popular belief, I am very interested in sleep, however, time does not allow me to explore this interest. Other things I‚Äôm interested in include binge watching dramas, music, robotics, photography, and just exploring.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to be there for my mentee with whatever they need, whether it comes to professional advice, academic advice, or even if they just want a familiar face/friend. If they have a similar major to me or a major that I know a lot about, then I can provide them with advice and tips. Even if I am not in a similar major, I just plan to be there for whatever my mentor needs (within reason‚Ä¶ some of these kids out there be wildin yknow).</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision my relationship with my mentee to be pretty close. I had aa wonderful experience with my mentor and I hope to provide the same thing to my mentee. I want the relationship to be more like a friendship than a mentor mentee relationship but honestly, I‚Äôm fine with whatever makes my mentee comfortable.</p>
