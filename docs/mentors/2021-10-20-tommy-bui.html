  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I jump between being way too serious about life and being way too goofy.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôll defer to someone much more eloquent and wiser than me. There‚Äôs a mathematician/entrepreneur named Charles Hoskinson, who in a podcast said this:</p>

<p>‚ÄúRemember, that you are judged for the things that you have and what you do with those things. Y‚Äôknow, if you have very little you still have to do something, and if you have a lot, you have to do even more. So learn how to give.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mentoring my peers who want it is one of the few ways I want to keep giving back to the people around me.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Continue my Software Engineering/tech career, with an eye towards developing products and services in the areas of AI/Machine Learning, environmental sustainability, and community/public discourse.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Vanguard, IT Developer Intern
Rise First, Web Content Developer
Sharing Excess, Web App Developer
U.S. Census Bureau, Web App Developer URBN (Nuuly), Jr. Machine Learning Engineer
Open Source (ask me about IT :D)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I write! Check out tnguyen21.github.io or overthinking.substack.com for a feel of what I write about.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also casually into fashion, dance, and music (mostly street culture stuff like hip-hop, r&amp;b). In my free time I read a lot of fiction (web comics, manga, novels), and non-fiction (history, essays, newsletters, philosophy, tech news).</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, life is very busy so I may not be able to give as much time as a mentee would like/want for mentorship.</p>

<p>That being said, my hopes is to meet for a deep chat (1-2 hours) so mentees and I can learn more about each other during the beginning of the program. From there, I‚Äôd like to develop ideas and plans to help my mentee achieve whatever goals they‚Äôd like to achieve (both short and long-term goals). And then serve as a source of accountability for my mentees (either soft reinforcement by asking about goals during conversation, or a more formal accountability partner by setting up re-occurring check-ins).</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Friendly, professional, and rewarding.</p>
