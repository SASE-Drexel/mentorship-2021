  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Kenn. I‚Äôm a 3rd year in Computer Science. I love cooking, video games, and exploring new areas in the cities! Other than that, I self identify myself as an ambivert, so I alternate between very social and very socially awkward at the same time :)</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>The prime reason is that i have alot of regrets during my first 2 year in Drexel University, and so I want to make sure that no one else would repeat the same mistakes that I have done before, ie .attending more events and focusing alot more time on making Friendships rather than solely focusing only on GPAs. I also want to meet more people that I dont have a chance to meet with yet.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>To become knowledgable in a wide range of subjects, while practicing my problem solving skills in algorithm‚Äôs aspect. Also, am practicing on best SE development practices, as well as learning more about Machine Learning in general.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>A Research Lab</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Food; Cooking a ton of food and sharing them with others :). (Also im down for Rainbow 6 Siege :) ). Other than that, contributing to video gamest hat I loved from my childhood is also a big thing in my life (who doesn‚Äôt want to relive their childhood anyways???).</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to just get to know them, and then be there whenever they need me to review their resumes, give advice on future careers, and also be there if they need someone to be a friend of them. Finally, I plan to drag them to every single SASE event that involves a mentor/mentee pairing :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>It would be more like a friendship than a mentorship, as I am very new to the role of being a mentor‚Ä¶</p>
