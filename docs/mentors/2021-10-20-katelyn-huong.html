  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Even though I‚Äôm basically 21 years old, I still act like a kid most of the time. I love meeting new people and can pretty chill. I do like to stay in and just watch anime for a couple of hours with a box of frosted flakes too. I love to learn, whether it‚Äôs a game or how to tie a shoe, I‚Äôll definitely be interested. Also I like food, but then I can get serious food comas.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a SASE Mentor, because after experiencing half of a freshman year in person and online, there were a list of things that I regret doing, but at the same time a number of things that I‚Äôm happy that I did do and I don‚Äôt want anyone to make any of the same mistakes. I also want to be a SASE Mentor because it‚Äôs almost second nature to me to want to help people in any way that I possibly can.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Still in the air with a couple of things, but I do want to work for a bigger known corporation, maybe in medical devices. I can‚Äôt say that I have a specific career goal in mind, but I hope to be able to work as hard as possible to be in a place and be proud of how far I‚Äôve come.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Terumo Medical Corporation, Johnson &amp; Johnson</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love to bullet journal and play tetris. I‚Äôm also interested in anime and drawing. I‚Äôm interested in making memories with my friends and exploring new places, whether it‚Äôs a new or old location. Boba is definitely a favorite, even though my favorite flavor is milk tea. I like j-pop and k-pop, specifically DAY6. I want to get into games more, I‚Äôm not too sure which though (I do like watching people play).</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would try keeping in contact with them as much as possible, and if they play any games, maybe have them take the place of a mentor and let them teach me the ropes of a game. Maybe have some virtual ‚Äúdates√¢‚Ç¨¬ù with them until we can actually meet up for a real one :)). I also plan on mentoring them not only through SASE, but also through any trouble that they might find themselves in. I do have a sweet tooth so maybe some cooking and baking nights are to be expected, as well as √∞≈∏≈Ω‚Ä∞introduce them to our current little family√∞≈∏≈Ω‚Ä∞</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I hope to have a relationship where we can bug each other at who knows what time of day and talk about the most random things. I don‚Äôt want to be a mentor, but also someone that my mentee can trust and feel comfortable about the current situation and transitioning into Drexel.</p>
