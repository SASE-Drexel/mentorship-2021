  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi, my name is Tarana and I‚Äôm a second year studying Management Information Systems. I was born in Bangladesh and I live right outside of Philly! I‚Äôm a bit shy, quiet, and introverted, but I can talk nonstop about some topics. I‚Äôm also obsessed with cats.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I was a mentee last year and had an amazing mentor who I learned a lot from. I look forward to finding someone who I can genuinely help and connect with.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm unsure about which job position I want to aim for. In the meantime, I‚Äôll be continuing my research and interning for different companies during my time at Drexel. After graduation, I want to pursue my own projects alongside having a full-time job.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I enjoy playing tennis, going on hikes, and watching anime. Some of my favorite animes are One Piece, Attack on Titan, and Demon Slayer. You can find me binge watching K-dramas at midnight often. I also love going out to eat and shopping.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I‚Äôll be there to answer all my mentee‚Äôs burning questions and help them get acclimated to Drexel as an underclassmen. I‚Äôd also be down for casual hangouts and mental/emotional support.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I want my mentee and I to become great buddies. I‚Äôll not only be there for professional, academic, general advice, but I‚Äôll also be there for their growth, comfort, and encouragement.</p>
