  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm a Filipino girl from the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, am halfway between extroverted and introverted. I am unafraid to try new things! I love fashion, making obscure references, and telling dad jokes. Also- SASE president Jackie Guan was one of the first friends I made at Drexel :)</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I have my own awesome SASE Mentor (shoutout to Darian), and being a third year I think I‚Äôve acquired a good amount of knowledge about the computer science program, college, and city life in general that I could spread around. Plus, I love making new friends!</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to work in something that works with people and incorporates aspects of graphic design, so hopefully UI/UX design or at the very least front-end development. I love problem solving as well as being creative!</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>eMoney Advisor- Software Engineer Co-op</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love painting, singing karaoke with friends, watching exciting TV and movies, and playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons on my Nintendo Switch. I‚Äôm also a shopping FIEND and will take any opportunity I can to go the thrift store to find cool clothes or pretty home decor!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Anyway they may need! Whether that be co-op search, understanding class content, figuring out how to navigate college life, or living/ having fun in the city, I can help with whatever. I can‚Äôt promise that I‚Äôm an expert on any of these subjects, but I can promise you that I‚Äôll help in whatever way I can (we can also get boba together :D)!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Friendly! I‚Äôm always down to hang out :D</p>
