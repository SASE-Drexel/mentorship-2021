<p>I want a be a SASE mentor because I love to help others out &amp; be of support to them. I may have just joined this organization but as an Upperclassman I know underclassmen are definitely struggling and want help but are afraid to do so. I have some trial &amp; error experiences that I would love to pass on to mentees. Also to help them be more comfortable &amp; if they need a someone to go somewhere, I‚Äôd be happy to be of a assistance.</p>
