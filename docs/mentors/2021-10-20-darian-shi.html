  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I think I‚Äôm a pretty authentic and down-to-earth person, but also definitely very analytical and goal-oriented. I really like to focus on being self-actualizing and constantly improving/growing. I generally like to plan a lot, but also see the value in being spontaneous!</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve been a part of SASE for all of my college career and I always come back to the mentorship program to give back to the underclassmen. I want to share my experiences and knowledge with others and help them through their own college journeys.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to apply my experiences in software and web development to a project or application that has a mission or purpose that I support and believe in. I also want to be able to just work in a field that I‚Äôm able ot try many new things and have flexbility in how I work, what I work on, etc.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Susquehanna International Group (Network Security Co-op), Phoodie INC. (Full-stack Developer), Imalogix (Full-stack and Software Developer)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I spend a lot of time rock climbing nowadays, but I also enjoy video games, watching shows, skating (inline, ice, and longboarding), cooking, biking, and reading. A few strange hobbies of mine include specialty coffee and building custom mechanical keyboards.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I plan to mentor my SASE Mentee by offering them access to any resources that I have, as well as providing myself as a resource for experience, knowledge, advice, etc.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I hope to have a relaxed and close friendship with my mentee, being able to offer them my knowledge and experience but also learn from them as well.</p>
