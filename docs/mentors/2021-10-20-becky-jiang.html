  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I live by the motto ‚ÄúWork hard, play hard‚Äù and try to make the most of both my professional and personal experiences. As an ENTJ, I enjoy getting to know people and their stories, maintain a balance between school, work and social life, and am passionate about continuous learning and improvement.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>As a college senior with experiences in not only going through the co-op process, but also independent search and full time recruiting, I believe I have a lot of professional career prep to offer mentees. I had a great time with my mentor when I first joined SASE, and would like to make someone else‚Äôs experience better.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I love MIS + BA because it is at the intersection of business and technology, which are both my passions. I aspire to work with data, and collaborate in teams to solve problems, and I think consulting is a great middle ground for that.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>APO Technologies (engineering startup- Engineering Co-op), Uncommon Goods (external internship- Operations Intern), Customized Energy Solutions (Operations Analyst)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Art galleries and museums, traveling, casual hiking, reading and trip planning</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>The relationship I would like to have with my SASE mentee would be dependent on what they‚Äôd like to get out of it. I am flexible and versatile and can offer academic, professional or even personal life advice to help a younger student navigate through their college career.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision it to be supportive, and as casual or professional as my mentee would like it to be. Ultimately this is aimed to help them grow and improve.</p>
